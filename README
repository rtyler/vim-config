Included in this directory is a set of scripts/configuration
files I use for normal development

To use the scripts just execute the following:
	`mv dotvimrc ~/.vimrc && mv dotvim ~/.vim`

The set up was originally created by John M. Anderson (sontek) and
slightly modified for some things like fancier autocompletion

You can find sontek's original post and tarball here:
